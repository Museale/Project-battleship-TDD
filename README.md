## Game logic

[x] create ships for player and computer
[] create gameboard
[] player should be able to place ships on board
[] computer should randomly place ships on board
[] ships cannot be placed next to another ship
[] ships cannot be placed on a taken square
[] on click add one 'hit'
[] when hit = length sunk = true, then remove ship from gameboard && update score
[] when player.ships.length = 0, then computer won and vice versa / alternatively add a score for each hit
